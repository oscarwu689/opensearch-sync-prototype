# OpenSearch Sync Prototype

This is a prototype project written in Rust to experiment with:

- Creating and managing OpenSearch index schema
- Handling simulated post events (created, updated, deleted)
- Syncing post data to OpenSearch
- (Optional) Redis deduplication to prevent redundant writes

Use this as a reference when integrating OpenSearch in production services.
